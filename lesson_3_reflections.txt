Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others.  When using multiple devices.  When wanting a remote backup of files.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes you are working on locally may be overwritten by someone else pushing changes to the same branch if automatic pulls were to occur.
