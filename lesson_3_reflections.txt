Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating with others.  When using multiple devices.  When wanting a remote backup of files.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes you are working on locally may be overwritten by someone else pushing changes to the same branch if automatic pulls were to occur.

Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork someone else's github repository to customize it for your needs.
Clone the fork to bring it to your local machine so you can work on it.
Add branches to the clone when experimenting with new features while wanting to keep the master in tact.

Q4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Reduces the number of potential conflicts when committing future changes (e.g. on a collaborative project)

Q5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Saving files as different versions.  Git and GitHub are much cleaner and provide better access to past working states.
